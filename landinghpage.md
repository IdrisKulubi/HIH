## 3. Technical & Design Notes

*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Most MSE owners will access this via mobile phones. The "Apply" buttons must be sticky or easily accessible on mobile screens.
*   **Speed:** Images must be optimized (WebP format) to load fast on 4G/3G networks common in rural Kenya.
*   **Accessibility:** Use high-contrast colors (Hand in Hand Blue & Yellow/White) for readability. Ensure all images have Alt Text.
*   **Language:** Keep English simple and professional. Consider a toggle for "Kiswahili" version if possible for inclusivity.
